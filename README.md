So much of the software we rely on every day is built on open source projects. We believe wholeheartedly that embracing open source makes our products the best they can be.

For us, open source isn't just about the end result, it's about the journey. It's about connecting with a wider community of builders and creators. We take pride not only in what we build, but how we build it, and we want to share that process with you. We appreciate the elegance of well-crafted code and know we'll learn tremendously from community contributions along the way.

That's why supporting open source contributors and makers is central to our mission. We provide this support through community recognition, collaboration opportunities, and financial rewards.

## The open source work we value

These open source projects particularly align with our mission:

- **Libraries:** Utilities that let us focus on building great products
- **Boilerplates:** Templates that give our projects a running start
- **Workflow tools:** Automation that helps maintain our development flow
- **Team experiments:** Code that helps us test new possibilities
- **Team OSS:** Open source products built under the Dwarves banner
- **Products we use:** Open source tools the Dwarves team values daily

## Why ownership matters

We've found that a sense of ownership is crucial to creating quality software. We naturally invest more care into things we own and will often dedicate personal time to nurture them. Software development follows this same principle.

For the open source projects we support, we encourage you to host them under your own name, unless it's an official Dwarves-driven project. If you'd like our community to recognize your contributions:

- **Add [our badge](https://github.com/dwarvesf/badge)** to show your OSS is recognized by the Dwarves community
- **Get credit** by submitting your work to the Dwarves open source [hall of fame](https://github.com/dwarvesf/opensource)

If your open source project gains traction, we're happy to help with launch and distribution to our community.

## How we reward contributors

Too often, the dedicated maintainers behind essential open source projects go uncompensated. We're working to change that by offering meaningful rewards:

- **Pull requests to open source projects:**
  - 10 ICY for small improvements or bug fixes
  - 20-50 ICY for new features or ideas
  - 50-150 ICY for major releases or architectural work
- **Publications:** 20-50 ICY for write-ups on tech trends or state-of-the-art development
- **OSS products:** 50-250 ICY based on the product's impact on Dwarves members, plus 50-100 ICY/month for active maintainers who continue to advance the product
